    "Beginning with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify market trends, this project builds a trading bot that uses LSTM networks to predict changes in the price of Bitcoin on the Binance platform. Four models were created using the knowledge obtained: a Linear Regression model, two LSTM variations and a Naive Baseline for benchmarking. To evaluate the efficacy of the LSTM Normal and Linear Regression models thorough backtesting was done. These models were tested in real-world trading environments. The setup specifications and operation of the trading bot are described in this README."
